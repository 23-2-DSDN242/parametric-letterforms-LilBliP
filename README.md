## Parluxst
meaning: greetings to the light of the morning

## Design
I began the project initally unsure of the direction i wanted to go in i had the idea to link this project into one of my own personal world building projects or but i was initally unsure eventually i decided that i might as well. and so i decided on creating an Alphabet for one of the early languages of the Tunak (Parluxst). A spacefaring race of turtle like humanoids whos ancient history and cultures I plan to create and catalogue both as an absolute record and as an in universe textbook style telling with all the inacuraccy and misunderstanding that entails.

To that end I decided on using this as a starting point for this assignment. with that in mind I began by taking a small collection of words linked to simple concepts and often used items, and taking one of their primary phonemes(distinct units of sound such as p, b, d,  and t seen in the words pad, pat, bad, and bat) to be used as a letters for this project. Once I had assisgned a word to each unique Phoneme in Parluxst i created a basic symbol which literaly depicts the concept or item of the word for example a drawing of a rock for the word meaning rock.

because Parluxst has far fewer Consonants than english and thus the 26 letter alphabet is too large i stretched the number of letters by having a unique sybol for each vowel variation rather than the single symbol system that english uses for vowels. This got me to the magic 26 and from here it was simply a matter of simplifing and then creating the symbols for code. The simplification of symbols wents well as I managed to reduce the symbols complexity down to 4 lines and two arcs at most with many having less than this.
